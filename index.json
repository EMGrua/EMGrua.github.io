Such clustering is mostly performed in an offline fashion. For a health and wellbeing setting, offline clustering might however not be suitable, as limited data is often available and patient states can also quickly evolve over time. Existing online clustering algorithms are not suitable for the health domain due to the type of data that involves multiple time series evolving over time. In this paper we propose a new online clustering algorithm called CluStream-GT that is suitable for health applications. By using both artificial and real datasets, we show that the approach is far more efficient compared to regular clustering, with an average speedup of 93%, while only losing 12% in the accuracy of the clustering with artificial data and 3% with real data.","tags":["Online clustering","Clustering","Time series","e-Health"],"title":"CluStream-GT: Online Clustering for Personalization in the Health Domain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eoin Martino Grua","Ivano Malavolta","Patricia Lago"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553857360,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553857360,"objectID":"20f14de076334381e58ebffb06a8459c","permalink":"/publication/slr-self-adaptive-apps/","publishdate":"2019-03-29T12:02:40+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/slr-self-adaptive-apps/","section":"publication","summary":"With their increase, smartphones have become more integral components of our lives but do to their mobile nature it is not possible to develop a mobile application the same way another software system would be built. In order to always provide the full service, a mobile application needs to be able to detect and deal with changes of context it may be presented with. A suitable method to achieve this goal is self-adaptation. However, as of today it is difficult to have a clear view of existing research on self-adaptation in the context of mobile applications. In this paper, we apply the systematic literature review methodology on selected peer-reviewed papers focusing on self-adaptability in the context of mobile applications. Out of 607 potentially relevant studies, we select 44 primary studies via carefully-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then use known modelling dimensions for self-adaptive software systems as our classification framework, which we apply to all selected primary studies. Then, we synthesize the obtained data and produce a clear overview of the state of the art. The results of this study give a solid foundation to plan for future research and practice on self-adaptive mobile applications.","tags":[],"title":"Self-Adaptation in Mobile Apps: a Systematic Literature Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eoin Martino Grua","Mark Hoogendoorn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542538016,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542538016,"objectID":"639ebb48a0af484e396a43ae0fcb7390","permalink":"/publication/effective-reinforcement-learning/","publishdate":"2018-11-18T11:46:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/effective-reinforcement-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Personalisation has become omnipresent in society. For the domain of health and wellbeing such personalisation can contribute to better interventions and improved health states of users. In order for personalisation to be effective in this domain, it needs to be performed quickly and with minimal impact on the users. Reinforcement learning is one of the techniques that can be used to establish such personalisation, but it is not known to be very fast at learning. Cluster-based reinforcement learning has been proposed to improve the learning speed. Here, users who show similar behaviour are clustered and one policy is learned for each individual cluster. An important factor in this effort is the method used for clustering, which has the potential to influence the benefit of such an approach. In this paper, we propose three distance metrics based on the state of the users (Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping, and high-level features) and apply different clustering techniques given these distance metrics to study their impact on the overall performance. We evaluate the different methods in a simulator with users spawned from very distinct user profiles as well as overlapping user profiles. The results show that clustering configurations using high-level features significantly outperform regular reinforcement learning without clustering (which either learn one policy for all or one policy per individual).","tags":["Health care","Reinforcement Learning","Personalization"],"title":"Exploring Clustering Techniques for Effective Reinforcement Learning based Personalization for Health and Wellbeing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice Frantz Schneider","Sepideh Matinfar","Eoin Martino Grua","Diego Casado-Mansilla","Lars Cordewener"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525948003,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525948003,"objectID":"afd730e5dda4a0697137335619aab934","permalink":"/publication/sustainable-smartphones/","publishdate":"2018-05-10T11:26:43+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sustainable-smartphones/","section":"publication","summary":"Based on the Sustainable Development Goals introduced by the United Nations and on the circular economy concept, ICT providers are adapting to become more sustainable. Some assess the CO2 emissions in the whole life cycle, while others propose to use renewable energies during manufacturing and assembling. In contrast with the current smartphone business models that rely on ongoing patterns of production and consumption, this paper proposes a more sustainable approach by combining product modularity, Product-Service Systems (PSS), and design for attachment. With a modular design, it becomes easier to repair the product or to replace parts, allowing for an extended lifespan. In combination with PSS, we propose that the modules, when no longer used by one customer, return to the market to be reused by another one. Lastly, we discuss the impact of the usersâ€™ behaviour through emotional bond, personalization, and technology appropriation as predictors of attachment to the product and consequently an extended lifespan. Through comparing case studies and using Life Cycle Assessment to calculate the CO2 equivalent emissions, we argue that our approach would directly reduce the environmental impact of the smartphone on the production phase, which accounts for most of the emissions throughout its life cycle.","tags":["circular economy","design for Attachment","environmental impact","Life Cycle Assessment","Sustainable Development Goals"],"title":"Towards a sustainable business model for smartphones: Combining product-service systems with modularity","type":"publication"}]
